TrisanoAuth
================

Adds AuthLogic support to TriSano (R).

To enable this plugin, you need to:
1) script/generate trisano_auth
2) smackdb (you can't just migrate)
3) Remove any auth related parameters in site_config.yml (or setup.yml).

The default password for all default users is 'changeme'.

To run the features:
1) Add features/standard vendor/plugins/trisano_auth/features/standard  -r vendor/plugins/trisano_auth/features/standard_step_definitions -r vendor/plugins/trisano_auth/features/support to cucumber.yml in the root dir
2) cucumber vendor/plugins/trisano_auth/features/standard -p standard

NOTE: Currently, installing this plugin will cause many of the specs and features to fail.

Also, don't use auth_logic and the user switcher option. They aren't meant to be together.
