<strong>Note to the project owner</strong> 
</p>

<p>
This is the <strong>Releases </strong>page. You can use this page to communicate about the releases planned for this project. Project members will want to know when each release is due, its current status, the artifacts that are expected to be resolved in it, and other information. 
</p>

<p>
One good way to track releases is to create a freeform page for each release. Clicking the name of a given release shows that release's home page.
