 <strong>Note to project owner</strong>

<p>
 This is the <strong>Working system</strong> work products page.  You can use this page to communicate and store working system related documentation (release notes, operational procedures, training, etc.).  This is also a great place to capture customer feedback before they get converted to user stories or defect reports in Project Tracker.
