<p>
                  To work on a project in CollabNet project pages, you must join the project.                    
</p>
                                     
<p>
                  <strong>Note: </strong>If you are not ready to join a project, you can sign up to monitor a project from your <strong>My Start Page</strong>.                   
</p>
                                     
<p>
                  There are three ways you can join a project:             
</p>
                   <ul>   <li><strong>R</strong><strong>espond to an invitation</strong>                  
<p>
                  You can join a project in response to an invitation from the project owner. When a project owner invites you to join a project, you receive an email containing a link to a page where you can request a role in the project. Project invitation is a common practice among open-source communities and decentralized development teams.                  
</p>
               </li>   <li><strong> Follow a link from your My Projects page</strong>                 
<p>
                  You can be assigned to a project by a project owner. When a project owner adds you to a project, a link to the project appears on your My Projects page. Project assignment is a common practice among centralized development teams that need to  control project membership.                    
</p>
           </li>       <li><strong> Browse and self-register</strong>                
<p>
            On some sites, you can peruse project lists, select a project that you would like to join and register as a member.       
</p>
       </li>    </ul>  <strong> </strong>
