<p>
                 To contribute to a CollabNet-based project, work your way through this cycle as many times as necessary:           
</p>
              <ol>    <li> <strong>View artifacts assigned to you.</strong>             
<p>
      The <strong>Artifacts</strong> page helps you find the Project Tracker artifacts that affect you. You also get an automatic alert by email when someone has modified an artifact you are interested in, such as an action item.          
</p>
           </li>       <li><strong>Get a working copy</strong>                
<p>
              Use a Subversion client to create or update a local working copy of the code. A  working copy is the replicated set of project version control files you maintain and modify on your own local machine. It's critical to keep your working copies of files up to date with the repository.                 
</p>
           </li>       <li><strong>Work on the code</strong>             
<p>
           When you have checked out a local copy of the project repository, you can start working on existing files with the tools of your choice. Any changes you make will only affect your local copies of  project files until you commit your changes back to the Subversion repository.                 
</p>
           </li>      <li><strong>Compare changes</strong>              
<p>
                 Compare your own code changes with the  repository master copy. It is a good practice in version control to review your changes before  committing them to the project's repository.                 
</p>
                 </li>     <li><strong>Resolve conflicts</strong>                 
<p>
           Subversion handles auto merges of non-conflicting changes and displays warnings for any conflicts that it detects.      Review Subversion's detection and warning signs for file conflicts. When you have resolved the conflicts, merge the changes published to the repository with your local changes and edit the resulting file.          
</p>
           </li>       <li> <strong>Commit         </strong>         
<p>
                 Use your Subversion client to submit your changed code to the repository. All commits are logged automatically and posted to the project's commits mailing list.   
</p>
   </li>   </ol>
