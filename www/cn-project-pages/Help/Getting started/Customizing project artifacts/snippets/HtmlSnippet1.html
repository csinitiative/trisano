                               An artifact represents a unit of work that moves through your development process until completion. A participant in your project receives an artifact, does the work it indicates, updates the artifact, and passes it along as appropriate. Project Tracker is a tool for creating, managing and tracking artifacts.                                
</p>
                                                            
<p>
                              CollabNet's baseline project template comes with three types of artifacts:                                
</p>
                                       <ul>     <li>  <strong>Requirement</strong>: A description of some functionality that the project must deliver, along with information about who will develop it, review it, document it, and so on.  </li>         <li><strong>  Defect report</strong>: A description of behavior that is different from the functionality specified in a requirement artifact.  </li>         <li><strong>  Action item</strong>: A discrete activity that must be carried out in order to move a requirement through the process.  </li>     </ul>                                               
<p>
                               Before you use any of these artifacts, Project Tracker needs to know what options to present to the user in the artifact's data entry fields. To provide that information, follow these steps:                               
</p>
                                     <ol>     <li> On the <strong>Configure</strong> page, click <strong>Manage Artifact types</strong>. </li>         <li> Click the artifact type you want to customize. </li>         <li> Under <strong>Attribute groups</strong>, click &lt;<strong>Artifact type</strong>&gt;<strong> submission information</strong>. </li>         <li> Under <strong>Attributes in this group</strong>, click the name of one of the default attributes, such as <strong>Component</strong>.</li>               <li> In the <strong>Attribute option in this project</strong> column, enter the name under which this option will appear in your project. For example, if you want users to choose from a list of possible components, enter the name of each possible component.  All the values in this column that are in <strong>[</strong>square brackets<strong>]</strong> should be customized before you start using the artifact for your project.                                 </li>         <li>For each attribute option that you will not use, clear the <strong>Active</strong> check box.     </li>       <li>Go back up to <strong>Attribute groups</strong> and click &lt;<strong>Artifact type</strong>&gt;<strong> tracking information.</strong> Repeat steps 4 and 5.           </li>      </ol>            
<p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> You can add an attribute that is not provided by default. Choose one of the attributes under <strong> tracking information</strong>  labeled <strong>[user_def...]</strong>, give it the name you want, and select the <strong>Active</strong> check box.<strong>      </strong>
