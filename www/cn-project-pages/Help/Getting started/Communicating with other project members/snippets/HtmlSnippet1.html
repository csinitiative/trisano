               <h3>Discussion forums</h3>               
<p>
             You can think of a discussion forum as a kind of bulletin board. It is a place where users and project owners can post notices, send/reply to messages and maintain a running exchange of ideas. Use discussion forums to communicate with other project members without transmitting sensitive information over email.

              To use a discussion forum, click <strong>Discussion forums</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> page and subscribe to the forum you are interested in.
