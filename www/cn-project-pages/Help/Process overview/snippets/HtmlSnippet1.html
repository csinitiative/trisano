CollabNet's agile process helps you manage globally distributed development projects effectively. Your CollabNet project is a hub for communication and collaboration, giving globally distributed team members a common and unified vision. 
</p>

<p>
Using CollabNet's project workspace, project members can work as one team throughout the lifecycle of a software project, regardless of their location. The project's evolving scope, progress, and quality are visible to key stakeholders at all times.&nbsp; This is especially critical in a project following the agile process as timely communication on plans and status is key to the success of the project.

<h3>Total adaptability</h3>
<p>
CollabNet project templates can be completely adapted to your organizational and project needs. Use this template as the starting point for developing your own internal process. 
</p>

<p>
If you come up with a process that you would like to share with other projects, your host administrator can save this project as a template that others can select during project creation. 
</p>

<p>
Note: If your project follows a simple process or a Unified Process (such as the Rational Unified Process&trade;), you can start with a template designed to support that process. For information about available templates, see <a href="http://open.collab.net" target="_blank">openCollabNet</a>.

<h3>Close control</h3>
<p>
Timely, relevant information helps business owners and other stakeholders align distributed software development practices with desired business objectives. CollabNet provides a topical view of the project that supports the information needs of all the project's stakeholders, regardless of their technical ability. You can switch between a &quot;tool-centric&quot; view and a &quot;process-centric&quot; view, whichever fits your requirements and work patterns. 
</p>

<p>
CollabNet's rich set of editing capabilities provide an easy way to display, organize, and find information about your project. You get a combination of page definitions, document templates, and Project Tracker components (such as artifact types, attributes, attribute options, and queries), all of which can be tailored to your project's unique needs.
