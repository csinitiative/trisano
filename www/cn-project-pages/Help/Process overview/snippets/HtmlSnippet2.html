CollabNet's agile process comes with a set of ready-to-use assets: 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Project pages</strong>. A project owner can use these to manage project information, share documentation, provide views into project artifacts, and much more.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Project Tracker artifacts</strong>. User stories, tasks, and defect reports help plan and track the scope of releases and iterations through the lifecycle of the project.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Project Tracker queries</strong>. Project members can quickly query artifacts to get started on their own assignments, or to get a deep dive into project scope.</li></ul>
