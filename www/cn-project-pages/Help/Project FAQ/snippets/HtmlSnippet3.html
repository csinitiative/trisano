<ol><li>Using your Subversion client, upload the picture to the &quot;/trunk/www/alm-process/images&quot; directory.</li><li>Under the html page component where you want the picture to appear, click <strong>Edit</strong>, then open the HTML editor.</li><li>In the place where you want the picture to appear, enter a standard &quot;img&quot; tag and set your &quot;src&quot; property to something like the following: &quot;/alm-process/images/my_image.gif&quot;.</li><li>Click <strong>Update &rArr; Save</strong>. </li></ol>Note: All SVN-based Web content should be placed within the &quot;/trunk/www&quot; directory. All URLs to this content can be expressed relative to this directory (e.g. &quot;/mycontent&quot; resolves to &quot;/trunk/www/mycontent&quot;).<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>How do I embed a link to a Subversion-based document in a project page?</strong><br />
<ol><li>Using your Subversion client, upload the document to an appropriate subdirectory of the &quot;/trunk/www&quot; directory (for instance &quot;/trunk/www/documents&quot;).<br />
</li><li>Under the html page component where you want the link to appear, click <strong>Edit</strong>, then open the HTML editor.</li><li>In the place where you want the link to appear, enter a standard &quot;anchor&quot; tag and set your &quot;href&quot; property to something like the following: &quot;/documents/my_doc.doc&quot;.</li><li>Click <strong>Update &rArr; Save</strong>. </li></ol>Note: Documents can be uploaded to Subversion in two ways. The first is by adding them to the repository using a client. The second is by uploading them through the &quot;documents&quot; page component.<br />
<br />

</li></ol></li><li><strong>When editing project pages I sometimes see an error message stating that another user is making edits and to try again later, but I know I'm the only one editing. What gives?<br />
</strong><br />
Given the complex interaction between the browser-based content editor, the underlying Subversion repository, and the Apache-based publishing area, at times the system cannot differentiate between changes being made by multiple users from changes being made by a single user. To help minimize the chances of this, simply wait for the &quot;Changes pending&quot; message to disappear between content updates.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>When I reorder, insert, or remove project pages, the freeform page links break in seemingly unrelated pages (e.g. the releases and help pages). Why does that happen?<br />
</strong><br />
The current project page implementation uses directory name prefixes in the Subversion repository to store page order information (e.g. &quot;1-Project tools&quot; denotes that the &quot;Project tools&quot; page is the first page after the &quot;Project home&quot; page). Furthermore, because freeform page content is contained within the top-level page and subpage directories, freeform page URLs must contain the bounding directory names.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if you make a change that results in changes to the sequence prefix of pages or subpages (by reordering, inserting, or removing project pages), the freeform page links on any affected pages may break. To fix them, simply adjust the URLs using the HTML component editor. To help minimize this problem, consider hiding pages rather than removing them (you may want them later anyway).<br />
<br />
CollabNet will fix this freeform page dependency problem in an upcoming release.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>I see lots of &quot;br&quot; tags in the html of this FAQ. How do I enter &quot;br&quot; tags in the html editor?<br />
</strong><br />
Press shift+enter when you want to enter a &quot;br&quot;. You won't regret it.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>When I launch Project Tracker I see hundreds of saved queries. Why are they there?<br />
</strong><br />
One of the more important benefits of project pages is that they streamline user navigation to underlying software development tools through embedded html page component links. In the CollabNet-provided templates we have included a series of links that result in the execution of saved Project Tracker queries (e.g. in the &quot;Artifacts&quot;, &quot;Releases&quot;, and &quot;Lifecycle&quot; pages).<br />
<br />
As of version 4.5.1 of CollabNet Enterprise Edition, an individual saved Project tracker query is required for each unique query invoked from project page links. While this results in a *lots* of saved queries, we believe the utility of providing streamlined navigation through embedded page links outweighs the overhead of having so many queries. If you disagree, just delete them.<br />
<br />
CollabNet will provide a fix that reduces the number of required saved queries in an upcoming release.<br />

</li><li><strong>The supplied content is only complete up to the 3rd release. Now that I am ready to deliver the 4th release, how do I flesh out the pages to accommodate this?<br />
</strong><br />
In order to create new release pages, you will need to do the following...<br />
<ol><li>On the &quot;Releases&quot; page, click on <strong>Edit this page</strong>.</li><li>In the freeform page area, copy an existing freeform release page.</li><li>Rename the freeform page to the name of your release.<br />
</li><li>Edit the freeform page to add or remove content based on your needs.<br />
</li><li>For each new query that you would like to add to the iteration rows...<br />
</li><ol><li>Under Project tools, launch Project Tracker and select the Query tab.</li><li>Create a new query, test it, and save it when you are satisfied.<br />
</li><li>Execute the query and copy the URL from the browser address field.</li><li>Link the copied URL to the appropriate text for the iteration query.</li></ol>Note: If you have plans to &quot;templatize&quot; your page content (see #9), you should remove the &quot;http://yourdomain&quot; from the above URLs (they should start with &quot;/servlets&quot;).<br />
<br />
<li>Once your freeform page is complete, add a new row to the &quot;Releases planned for this project&quot; table and modify the content of the row according to your needs.<br />
</li><li>To link your newly created freeform page to the release name, select the newly created freeform page from the &quot;available links&quot; section of the html link tool in the html editor.</li><li>To create and link the release level Project Tracker queries, simply follow the steps in item e.</li><li>Test your new freeform release page and Project Tracker query links to ensure they are working as desired.<br />
<br />
</li></ol></li><li><strong>I've just spent several days perfecting my project content and now I'd like to use this content as the starting point for newly created projects. How do I do this?<br />
</strong><br />
You must be a host admin to create new project templates based on existing projects (making them available to others during project creation). If you are interested in having CollabNet help you do this, please contact your local CollabNet representative for assistance. In the meantime, the contents of the &quot;/alm-process&quot; directory can be happily moved between projects (with some Subversion expertise).<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>This project template feature is really cool. Where do I go to get more templates from CollabNet (and the community) as they become available?<br />
</strong><br />
New templates are available on <a href="http://open.collab.net">openCollabNet</a>. If you see one you like, please ask your host or domain administrator to install them on your CollabNet installation.<br />
