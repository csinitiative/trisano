<strong>Note to the project owner</strong> 
</p>

<p>
This is the <strong>Project FAQ</strong> (Frequently Asked Questions) page. The best FAQs are written by project members themselves as they participate in the project over time. It's a good idea to seed this page yourself with some initial questions and answers. Try to think of questions that a real project participant might ask, such as &quot;Where are the project meetings held?&quot;<strong> </strong>
