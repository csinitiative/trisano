<br />
 The Utah Department of Health (UDOH), the Department of Technology Services<br />
 (DTS) and local health department (LHD) officials are working with the<br />
 Collaborative Software Initiative to collaborate in the development of a disease<br />
 reporting and surveillance system for the<br />
 state of Utah that is NEDSS compatible and compliant with the Public Information<br />
 Network.  This project is funded by a grant from Novell to CSI for the cost<br />
 of development and provide a bespoke, open source, project to meet the needs of<br />
 the State of Utah and, once released, to be extensible and configurable to meet<br />
 the needs of other jurisdictions as well.<br />

  <h3>Major components:</h3><br />
 <ul><br />
 <li>database designed to support both patient-centric and case/outbreak-centric<br />
 views of the recorded data<br />
 </li><li>report generation to CDC NEDSS and to UDOH<br />
 </li><li>case management subsystem<br />
 </li><li>outbreak management subsystem<br />
 </li><li>electronic transmission of information (migrate from paper, fax, and phone)<br />
 to and from local health departments (LHDs) UDOH and the CDC<br />
 </li></ul><br />

 <h3>Components need to have these high-level capabilities:</h3><br />
 <ul><br />
 <li>scalable, extensible design supporting both high-availability and disaster<br />
 recovery<br />
 </li><li>integral security capability to protect confidential patient information<br />
 web UI for access from by any authorized, web connected user with access to a<br />
 web browser<br />
 </li><li>local (laptop oriented) application with server synchronization<br />
 (asynchronous updates) for occasionally connected field users<br />
 </li><li>analytic (business intelligence) access to the data for ad hoc analysis and<br />
 reporting<br />
 </li><li>wireless (PDA, laptop, perhaps phone) access to critical functions for key<br />
 executive and field users<br />
 </li></ul><br />
