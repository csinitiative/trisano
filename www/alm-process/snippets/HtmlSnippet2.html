  <strong>Welcome to the CSI Utah-NEDSS Project.</strong><br />
 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
&lt;p&gt;<br />
The Utah Department of Health (UDOH), the Department of Technology Services<br />
(DTS) and local health department (LHD) officials are working with the<br />
Collaborative Software Initiative to collaborate in the development of a disease<br />
reporting and surveillance system for the<br />
state of Utah that is NEDSS compatible and compliant with the Public Information<br />
Network.&nbsp; This project is funded by a grant from Novell to CSI for the cost<br />
of development and provide a bespoke, open source, project to meet the needs of<br />
the State of Utah and, once released, to be extensible and configurable to meet<br />
the needs of other jurisdictions as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;h3&gt;Major components:&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;database designed to support both patient-centric and case/outbreak-centric<br />
views of the recorded data<br />
&lt;li&gt;report generation to CDC NEDSS and to UDOH<br />
&lt;li&gt;case management subsystem<br />
&lt;li&gt;outbreak management subsystem<br />
&lt;li&gt;electronic transmission of information (migrate from paper, fax, and phone)<br />
to and from local health departments (LHDs) UDOH and the CDC<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Components need to have these high-level capabilities:&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;scalable, extensible design supporting both high-availability and disaster<br />
recovery<br />
&lt;li&gt;integral security capability to protect confidential patient information<br />
web UI for access from by any authorized, web connected user with access to a<br />
web browser<br />
&lt;li&gt;local (laptop oriented) application with server synchronization<br />
(asynchronous updates) for occasionally connected field users<br />
&lt;li&gt;analytic (business intelligence) access to the data for ad hoc analysis and<br />
reporting<br />
&lt;li&gt;wireless (PDA, laptop, perhaps phone) access to critical functions for key<br />
executive and field users<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&nbsp;
