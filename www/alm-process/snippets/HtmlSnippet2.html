        The Utah Department of Health (UDOH), the Department of Technology Services (DTS) and local health department (LHD) officials are working with the Collaborative Software Initiative to collaborate in the development of a disease reporting and surveillance system for the state of Utah that is NEDSS compatible and compliant with the Public Information Network.  This project is funded by a grant from Novell to CSI for the cost of development and provide a bespoke, open source, project to meet the needs of the State of Utah and, once released, to be extensible and configurable to meet the needs of other jurisdictions as well.
