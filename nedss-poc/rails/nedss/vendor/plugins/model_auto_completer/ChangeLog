-- 1.4.1 (5 May 2007)
  * Reworded some bits of the documentation.

-- 1.4 (1 May 2007)
  * It turned out that Konqueror does no behave like Safari, so
    right now :send_on_return disables form submission only for
    Safari.

-- 1.3 (30 Apr 2007)
  * We only disable the return key in Safari and Konqueror (I assume
    Konqueror behaves like Safari, check pending) since Firefox and IE
    do not submit the form when you press return on the completion list.


-- 1.2 (29 Apr 2007)
  * Small change to the onkeypress handler.


-- 1.1 (25 Mar 2007)
  
  * [NEW] Added a callback that receives the text field element, the
  selected value, the hidden field element, and the extracted id.


-- 1.0 (17 Feb 2007)
  
  * [BUG] The foreign key was not properly retrieved sometimes
  (reported by James Stewart, thank you!)


-- 0.9 (22 Jan 2007)

  * Initial release
