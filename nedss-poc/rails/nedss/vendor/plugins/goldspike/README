This task allows you to package up your Rails web application
as a war file for deployment to Tomcat or another J2EE server.

It adds the following tasks to your project:

+ war:standalone:create
create a self-contained package which includes JRuby and any gems that are
required by the application.

+ war:shared:create
create a package containing only the application. JRuby and rails-integration
should be made available using a shared classloader. If JRUBY_HOME is set,
then this will be used to locate any Ruby libraries and gems.
