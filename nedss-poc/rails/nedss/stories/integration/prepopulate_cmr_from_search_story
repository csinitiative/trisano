Story: Pre-populate new CMR from people search

  As a user
  I want to be able to start a new CMR with data from a search pre-populating form fields
  So I can not have to repeat data entry tasks

  Scenario: Search for unknown user

    When I search for the non-existent person 'Xavier Xerces' with a birth date of '9/12/1988'
    Then there should be a link to create a new CMR
    
    When I click the link to create a new CMR
    Then the new CMR view displays
    And 'Xavier' should display in the first name field
    And 'Xerces' should display in the last name field
    And 'September 12, 1988' should display in the birth date field
