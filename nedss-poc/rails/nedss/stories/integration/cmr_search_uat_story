Story: CMR search user acceptance tests

  As a user
  I want to search for CMRs
  So I can know if they are already in the system

  Scenario: Search for known CMRs by disease
    
    When I search for all CMRs with the disease 'Chicken Pox'
    Then I should see at least one result with the disease 'Chicken Pox'
    And the user name and date of birth should be displayed for each result
    And a link to the CMR show page should be displayed for each result
