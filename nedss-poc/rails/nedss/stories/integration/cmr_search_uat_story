Story: CMR search user acceptance tests

  As a user
  I want to search for CMRs
  So I can know if they are already in the system

  Scenario: Search for known CMRs by disease
    
    When I search for all CMRs for the known person 'Karl Marks' with the disease 'Salmonela'
    Then I should see at least one result with the person 'Karl J. Marks' and the disease 'Salmonela'
    And the results should also include record number, age, county, and event date
