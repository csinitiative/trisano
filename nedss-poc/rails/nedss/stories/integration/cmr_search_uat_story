Story: CMR search user acceptance tests

  As a user
  I want to search for CMRs
  So I can know if they are already in the system

  Scenario: Search for known CMRs by disease
    
    When I search for all CMRs for the known person 'Karl Marks' with the disease 'Chicken Pox'
    Then I should see at least one result with the person 'Karl S. Marks' and the disease 'Chicken Pox'
    And the results should also include record number, age, county, and event date

  Scenario: Search for known CMRs with starts-with search
    
    When I search for all CMRs with the starts-with first name of 'K' and the last name starts-with of 'M'
    Then I should see at least one result with the person 'Karl S. Marks'

    When I search for all CMRs with the starts-with first name of 'K'
    Then I should see at least one result with the person 'Karl S. Marks'

    When I search for all CMRs with the starts-with last name of 'M'
    Then I should see at least one result with the person 'Karl S. Marks'

    When I search for all CMRs with the full text name of 'Karl Marks' and the starts-with last name of 'Xyz'
    Then the full text search should be ignored and no results should display
