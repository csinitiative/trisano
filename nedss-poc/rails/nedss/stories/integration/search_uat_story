Story: Search user acceptance tests

  As a user
  I want to search for people
  So I can know if they are already in the system

  Scenario: Search for known users
    
    When I search for the known person 'Karl Marks'
    Then known person 'Karl J. Marks' should appear in the search results.
    And the birthdate '1974-03-12' should appear in the search results.
    And the gender 'Male' should appear in the search results.
    And the county 'Salt Lake' should appear in the search results.

  Scenario: Search for users known not to exist

    When I search for the non-existent person 'Xavier Xerces'
    Then non-existent person 'Xavier Xerces' should not be returned.

  Scenario: Search for users with their names slightly mis-spelled

    When I search with the mispelled name 'Grocho Marks'
    Then the correctly spelled name of 'Groucho Julius Marx' should appear in the search results.

  Scenario: Search for users with their first and last names transposed

    When I search with the transposed names 'Marx Groucho'
    Then the non-tranposed name of 'Groucho Julius Marx' should appear in the search results.

  Scenario: Search for users by correct birthdate

    When I search for the person by birthdate 'Groucho Marx' by the correct birthdate of '10/2/1902'
    Then known person by birthdate 'Groucho Julius Marx' with correct birthdate '10/2/1902' should appear in the search results.

  Scenario: Search for users by incorrect birthdate

    When I search for the person by correct name 'Groucho Marx' but the incorrect birthdate of '10/2/1903'
    Then known person by incorrect birthdate 'Groucho Julius Marx' should not appear in the search results.
