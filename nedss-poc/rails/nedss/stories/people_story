Story: People management example; not so much an integration test but an example of lower level testing with story tests

  As a user
  I want to create a new person
  So that I can later associate them to an event

  Scenario: Create a new person

    Given a new person named 'Smith'
    And a number of existing persons
    
    When I save the person
    
    Then the person should be valid
    And there should be 1 more person stored
