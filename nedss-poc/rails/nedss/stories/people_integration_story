Story: People integration tests

  As a user
  I want to do manage people
  So that I can later associate them to an event

  Scenario: Manage people
    
    When I view the people listing

    Then the page title should be 'UT-NEDSS'
    And there should be a list of people
    And there should be a link to create a new person
    
    When I click the new person link

    Then I should be taken to the new person page

    Given that I can enter a first name of 'Bob'
    And that I can enter a last name of 'Ford'
    
    When I click the create button

    Then a new person should be created
