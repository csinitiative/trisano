Feature: Clicking a back to top link

  Scenario: Clicking a back to top link in morbidity edit mode
    Given I am logged in as a super user
    And a simple morbidity event for last name Jones
    When I am on the event edit page
      And I scroll down a bit
      And I click the back to top link
    Then I should have been scrolled back to the top of the page
