  # Debt: This spec was originally done with great haste and is very much a
  # happy-path test.
  # Holes:
  #  * Sleeps
  #  * Test permissions
  #   * Create task for super user, task for investigator
  #   * Switch to investigator, try to update task for superuser, assert there's an error message
  # * Doesn't exercise contact tasks
  # * Doesn't test links from the dashboard
  # * Assertions against CSS classes could be too fragile
