        <h2>Merging People</h2>
        <p>Duplicate records can sometimes be created when anyone entering data fails to recognize that the person for whom they are creating a record already exists in the database. The merge people feature allows you to conveniently combine duplicate records. </p>
        <p><b class="green">Note: </b>Use the merge feature with caution. It is a powerful tool that combines records for people and permanently deletes unwanted records.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To begin a merge:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click <b class="green">People</b> in the upper right corner of the page. The <b class="green">People</b> page opens.</li>
            <li value="2">Search for the person by entering the person's information into the search fields. You can search by <b class="green">Birth date</b> and/or by name. There are two ways to search by name:</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Enter a <b class="green">Last name</b> or <b class="green">First name</b> to match the name exactly.</li>
                <li value="2">Enter an incomplete <b class="green">Last name</b> or <b class="green">First name</b> and select the <b class="green">Use starts with search</b> box to perform a search with only partial name information. The less you enter, the wider the search. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click <b class="green">Search</b>. Once the search is done, a list of names appears under the search fields.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol start="4">
            <li value="4">Review the list of names and find the name that you want to merge people into. This is the name that will remain in the database when the merge is done. This person is the Keeper.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <b class="green">Merge</b> in the same row as the Keeper. The page refreshes with the Keeper listed at the top of the page. Under that person's name is a list of other people you can choose from to merge with the Keeper. These people are Mergees.</li>
            <li value="6">Select the <b class="green">Merge into</b> check boxes in the rows of the Mergees.</li>
            <li value="7">When you are done selecting Mergees, click <b class="green">Merge</b> at the top of the page. The Mergees are now merged into the Keeper.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When the merge is done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">All events that used to be associated with the Mergees are now associated with the Keeper. For example, this means that if there was a CMR or a contact associated with the Mergee, it now will belong to the Keeper.</li>
            <li value="2">The Mergees are deleted and no longer visible in the application.</li>
            <li value="3">Addresses that appear on events for the Mergees remain unchanged; they are not changed with a merge.</li>
        </ul>
