        <h2>Merging Places</h2>
        <p>Duplicate place records can sometimes be created when anyone entering data fails to recognize that a place may already have been entered into the database. The merge places feature allows you to conveniently combine duplicate records. </p>
        <p><b class="green">Note: </b>Use the merge feature with caution. It is a powerful tool that combines records for places and permanently changes addresses.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To begin a place merge:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click <b class="green">Places</b> in the upper right corner of the page. The <b class="green">Manage Places</b> page opens displaying its search options.</li>
            <li value="2">Enter the name or part of the name of the place you want to search for.</li>
            <li value="3">If you are sure about what type of place it is, select it from the <b class="green">Participation Type</b> list. If you are not sure, leave <b class="green">Participation Type</b> blank.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <b class="green">Search</b>. A list of places appears below the search fields.</li>
            <li value="5">Review the list of places and find the place that you want to merge places into. This is the place that will remain in the database when the merge is done. This place is the Keeper.</li>
            <li value="6">Click <b class="green">Merge</b> in the same row as the Keeper. The page refreshes with the Keeper listed at the top of the page. Under the Keeper's place name is a list of other places you can choose from to merge with the Keeper. These places are Mergees.</li>
            <li value="7">Select the <b class="green">Merge into</b> check boxes in the rows of the Mergees.</li>
            <li value="8">When you are done selecting Mergees, click <b class="green">Merge</b> at the top of the page. The Mergees are now merged into the Keeper.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the merge is done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">All events that used to be associated with the Mergees are now associated with the Keeper. For example, this means that if there was an event associated with the Mergee, it now will belong to the Keeper.</li>
            <li value="2">The Mergees are deleted and no longer visible in the application.</li>
            <li value="3">Addresses that appear on events for the Mergees are updated to the new address.</li>
        </ul>
