        <h2>About the CDC Export</h2>
        <p>The CDC Export is a report sent once a week to the CDC listing all cases of each defined disease. The report includes information on cases, their states, and information about each case that has changed significantly or has been deleted. The CDC requires that information be in a format they specify, based on a column model. A core set of data exists for each disease that is sent on a regular basis to the CDC.</p>
        <p>For certain disease groups, such as hepatitis and meningitis,the CDC specifies what data they want captured and reported. Most of the additional data required by the CDC is not part of the core data gathered and stored by CSI TriSano™. However, since the CDC requirements are installed with CSI TriSano™ and are available through the Admin area, you can capture the required data by including it as part of the custom fields on a Form Builder form.</p>
        <p>The Export Columns page allows you to configure the composition of what is exported. You can specify many options for the information, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">with what disease data is sent</li>
            <li value="2">in what column the data should appear</li>
            <li value="3">the format for the information</li>
            <li value="4">the disease group name for the set of diseases</li>
        </ul>
