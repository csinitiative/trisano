        <h2>About Event Routing Queues</h2>
        <p>An Event Routing Queue is a means for a local health department (LHD) to manage its internal workflow. It allows you to route an event to a queue, or list of cases, rather than to an individual. This allows your organization to maintain a list of outstanding cases to be worked on by all individuals and keeps the list active and moving at all times. You can define the queues as suits your organization.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For example, an LHD might have many investigators working on enteric diseases. The LHD could define a queue named Enteric. When you enter a new case of an enteric disease into CSI TriSano™, you can route it to the Enteric queue rather than to an individual investigator. Then any of the investigators at the LHD responsible for Enteric diseases can access the cases in the Enteric diseases queue, assign that case to himself or herself and begin the investigation.</p>
