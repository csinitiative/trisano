        <h2>About the CDC Export</h2>
        <p>The CDC Export is a report sent once a week to the CDC listing all cases of each defined disease. The report includes information on cases, their states, and information about each case that has changed significantly or has been deleted. The CDC requires that information be in a format they specify, based on a column model. The Export Columns page allows you to configure the composition of what is exported. You can specify many options for the information, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">with what disease data is sent</li>
            <li value="2">in what column the data should appear</li>
            <li value="3">the format for the information</li>
            <li value="4">the disease group it </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The CDC specifies what data they want captured and reported for certain  groups of diseases, such as hepatitis and meningitis. Most of the data required by the CDC is not part of the core data gathered and stored by CSI TriSano™. However, since the CDC requirements are installed with CSI TriSano™ and are available through the Admin area, you can capture the required data by including it as part of the custom fields on a Form Builder form.</p>
