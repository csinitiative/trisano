        <h2>About Form Builder</h2>
        <p>CSI TriSano™ includes a Form Builder tool that allows  you to extend its capabilities by capturing  additional information for existing or new public health situations. Form  Builder can be extremely useful during a disease outbreak, such as the recent  H1N1 influenza virus. It allows you to respond quickly  to emerging or changing health events by allowing you to create customized  forms.</p>
        <p>Form Builder lets you capture additional information for each of the  different event types including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="../../../About_CMRs/Confidential_Morbidity_Report.htm">Morbidity events (CMRs)</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="../../../About_Events/What_is_a_Contact_Event.htm">Contact events</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="../../../About_Events/What_is_an_Encounter_Event.htm">Encounter events</a>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><a href="../../../About_Events/What_is_a_Place_Exposure.htm">Place Exposures</a> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adding  Questions</h3>
        <p>Form Builder allows you to add questions to the existing tabs of a CMR. Unless otherwise specified, questions  added using Form Builder appear on the <a href="../../../About_CMRs/Investigation_Information.htm">Investigation</a> tab for the morbidity or contact event. You can also add questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To existing tabs of an event, such as the <a href="../../../About_CMRs/Demographic_Information.htm">Demographic</a>, <a href="../../../About_CMRs/Clinical_Information.htm">Clinical</a>, or <a href="../../../About_CMRs/Laboratory_Information.htm">Laboratory</a>  tabs  </li>
            <li value="2">Before or after existing questions on a tab  </li>
            <li value="3">As follow up questions that appear based on the answer to a  question you have defined or that already exists on one of the tabs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Considering Different Types of Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms can be simple or they can be very complex. In fact, you can simplify existing paper disease investigation forms when you automate them with Form Builder since repetitive data only needs to be entered once and optional  information is requested only when required. In addition, you can add help text  to any question created using Form Builder to guide the investigator. In addition, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Define forms for diseases for one or all jurisdictions</li>
            <li value="2">Copy form elements to the Form Library for use when creating other forms</li>
            <li value="3">Activate or deactivate forms  </li>
            <li value="4">Copy forms </li>
            <li value="5">Add forms to events that already exist in the system  </li>
            <li value="6">Remove forms from events  </li>
            <li value="7">Export forms to another CSI TriSano™ system  </li>
            <li value="8">Import forms from another CSI TriSano™ system </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creating a  Form&#160;</h3>
        <p>To create and publish a form you must:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><b class="green">Identify form elements to be defined </b>– The application  already contains a large amount of demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and  other data. Consider only additional data that you will  need to define in Form Builder.  </li>
            <li value="2"><b class="green">Create the form using Form Builder </b><b class="green"></b>– First, you must define basic  information about the form such as form name, diseases it applies to, and  jurisdictions where the form can be used. Next, you define the questions and  possible answers for additional information that is not already part of the application.&#160; Then, you specify the location of each question or group of questions  within the tabbed interface.  </li>
            <li value="3"><b class="green">Publish the form in Form Builder </b><b class="green"></b>– This makes the form available to the application and allows you to use it with new events. If necessary, you can add  the new form to events already in the system. Once you publish the form, it is  automatically assigned to any new event that is created in the system for any  disease that the form belongs with.</li>
        </ol>
