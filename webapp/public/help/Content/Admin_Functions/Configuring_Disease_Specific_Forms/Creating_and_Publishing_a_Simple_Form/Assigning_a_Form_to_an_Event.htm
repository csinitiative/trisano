        <h2>Assigning a Form to an Event</h2>
        <p>Form assignment refers to the&#160;relationship between&#160;an event, (CMR, Contact,  Encounter, or Place) and a published form. Assignment happens&#160;when the form is connected to a particular event. This normally occurs automatically,  but you can override automatic assignment and manage it manually, if you prefer.</p>
        <h3>Automatically&#160;Assigning  a Form</h3>
        <p>Forms are automatically assigned to an event in the following ways:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b><b class="green">At event-creation time</b> –</b>&#160;when the event is saved for the first time  </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">If the event has a disease associated with it, any forms associated with  that disease and the event's jurisdictions are assigned to the form. No other  form will be automatically assigned to&#160;this event in the future.  </li>
                <li value="2">If the event does not have a disease associated with it, no form is  assigned. </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b class="green">At event-update time</b> – when the event is saved in the future  </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">If the event has a disease associated with it and a form has not been  previously&#160;assigned, any forms associated with that disease and the event's  jurisdictions are assigned to the form. No other form will be automatically  assigned to&#160;this event in the future.  </li>
                <li value="2">If a disease is still not associated with the event, then no form assignment  occurs and the event remains eligible for automatic form assignment. <br class="atl-forced-newline" /></li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b color="#008000" class="green">Note:</b> If you change the disease assigned to  an even after you have already saved the event,&#160;the application does not  change&#160;the forms assigned to&#160;it. You must change the form assignment manually.  <br class="atl-forced-newline" /></p>
        <h3>Manually Assigning a Form to an Event</h3>
        <p>To manually assign a form:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click <b class="green">Add/Remove forms for this event</b>. <br></br><br></br><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Investigative_Information.jpg"></img><br></br><br></br></li>
            <li value="2">The page that opens contains form names that are available for this event. The page has&#160;two  sections:</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Forms in use</b> – can be removed from the event  </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Forms available for use</b> – can be added to the event<br class="atl-forced-newline"></br></li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="3">To add a form,&#160;if there are any listed, select the check box on&#160;the&#160;right side of the page and click <b class="green">Add Forms</b>. The form is added to the section called <b class="green">Forms in Use</b>.<b class="green"></b></li>
        </ol>
