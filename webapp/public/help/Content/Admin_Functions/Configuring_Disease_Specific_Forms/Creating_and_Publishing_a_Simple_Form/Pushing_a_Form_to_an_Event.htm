        <h2>Pushing a Form to an Event</h2>
        <p>The <b class="green">Push</b> feature&#160;assigns a form&#160;to&#160;existing events. It is an  efficient and time-saving way to assign a form to many events all at the same  time. For example,&#160;the database&#160;already has 100&#160;events for patients&#160;with  measles. The CDC sends you&#160;a new form containing&#160;questions that must be  included in&#160;measles events. You&#160;must create&#160;the form and then add it to the  events of all&#160;100 patients. You can do that one event&#160;at a time (see <a href="Assigning_a_Form_to_an_Event.htm">Assigning a Form to an Event</a>) or  you could add it to all 100 events&#160;at one time using <b class="green">Push</b>.  <br class="atl-forced-newline" /><br class="atl-forced-newline" />The <b class="green">Push</b> link  appears on the main <b class="green">Forms</b> page and on the <b class="green">Builder</b> and <b class="green">Edit</b> pages. Use <b class="green">Push</b>  when a form, typically a new or revised form, has been created and must  be&#160;assigned to a large group of events. Publishing a form does&#160;not assign it  to existing events automatically.&#160;</p>
        <p>Consider the following example: <br class="atl-forced-newline" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">There is one existing measles form.  </li>
            <li value="2">There are 40 morbidity events for measles in the system; the Monkeypox form  has been&#160;assigned to all 40 events and all the questions have been&#160;answered.  </li>
            <li value="3">You receive&#160;new measles form&#160;from the CDC, so you <b class="green">Create</b>&#160;the new  form&#160;using&#160;Form Builder and <b class="green">Publish</b> it.  </li>
            <li value="4">This newly published form will be assigned to new measles morbidity events,  but it will not be automatically assigned to the 40 morbidity events that already exist for the measles.  </li>
            <li value="5">If you want this new form to be attached to the already existing events, use <b class="green">Push</b>.   <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li value="6">Pushing&#160;does not assign the form to any events that already have a version  of this particular form assigned.  </li>
            <li value="7">If you&#160;need to access all the measles events that have the new form  assigned, you can&#160;use <b class="green">Search</b> and create a list of measles  events to be edited and updated. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To assign the a form  to all events for a selected disease that do not  already have this form assigned:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click <b class="green">Admin</b> in the upper right corner of the page.  </li>
            <li value="2">Click <b class="green">Manage&#160;Forms</b> under <b class="green">Disease Specific Forms</b>. The <b class="green">Forms</b> list opens  displaying the forms in alphabetical order. </li>
            <li value="3">To push this form to the events for a selected disease, located the form in the list and click  <b class="green">Push</b> in the same row as the disease. A message at the top of the screen tells you that the <b class="green">Form was  successfully pushed to events</b>. This means that the all events that have been assigned the selected disease for which the form was created, have now been assigned this form.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To verify that the form has been assigned to one of&#160;the events:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Click&#160;<b class="green">Events</b> in&#160;the upper&#160;right corner of the page. The&#160;Events List  opens.  </li>
            <li value="2">Locate&#160;an event that has the selected disease.  </li>
            <li value="3">Click <b class="green">Edit</b>.  </li>
            <li value="4">Select&#160;the <b class="green">Investigation</b> tab. Verify that the form has been assigned  to the event.</li>
        </ol>
