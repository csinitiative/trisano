        <h2>Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting<br /></h2>
        <p>CSI TriSano™ uses a third party analysis, visualization, and reporting (AVR) program called Pentaho™ BI Suite Enterprise Edition to warehouse your surveillance data and to create in-depth reports on it. It provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">a data warehouse that facilitates easy access to your CSI TriSano™ data for analysis, visualization, and reporting purposes with no impact on your day-to-day transactional system</li>
            <li value="2">an AVR tool, Pentaho™ BI Suite Enterprise Edition, that allows you to create ad hoc reports and perform real-time analysis of data plus management dashboards for at-a-glance insight into operations and overall public health</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The CSI TriSano™ Data Warehouse</h2>
        <p>The CSI TriSano™ Data Warehouse provides ad hoc query, reporting, and online analytical processing (OLAP) capabilities based on information extracted from the CSI TriSano™ transaction system. Data is extracted at user-defined intervals, transformed for ease of access, and loaded into a separate CSI TriSano™ data warehouse PostgreSQL database. Several different business models (groupings of data) for the data warehouse are automatically defined. In addition to supporting CSI TriSano™ core data, the data warehouse also fully supports data captured using disease-specific forms in each of the tools described below.</p>
        <h2>Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting (AVR)</h2>
        <p>CSI TriSano™ includes the following advanced Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting (AVR) features through Pentaho™ Enterprise Edition 3.0, embedded within CSI TriSano™, and the creation of Pentaho™ business models that use extracted transaction data. The business models provide pre-configured metadata overlays so that the Pentaho™ Business Intelligence platform can use the TriSano™ Data Warehouse.</p>
        <p>For AVR, the CSI TriSano™ Data Warehouse includes the following components.</p>
        <h3>Pentaho™ Ad Hoc Query and Reporting Tool</h3>
        <p>The web-based reporting tool allows you to create reports using selection fields in business terms provided by the pre-defined business models. You can create reports using an interactive drag-and-drop interface that supports grouping, summarizing, filtering, and formatting of data. You can export the reports in HTML, PDF, Excel and CSV formats. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">save the reports locally or in the Pentaho™ Solution Repository</li>
            <li value="2">run the saved reports later in the background</li>
            <li value="3">schedule reports to run in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pentaho™ Report Designer</h3>
        <p>The Pentaho™ Report Designer is an advanced reporting tool that allows you to create highly detailed reports using data stored in the CSI TriSano™ data warehouse. You can use its drag-and-drop graphical interface to control data access, layout, grouping, calculations, charting and formatting or you can use its reporting wizard. It includes report templates that provide a consistent look and feel.  You can upload the reports to a server or run them from a web browser.</p>
        <h3>Data Cube/OLAP Support</h3>
        <p>The Date Cube/OLAP capability in CSI TriSano™ allows you to work with large amounts of data in real-time using multi-diminsional analysis. The Pentaho™Analysis Services allow public health professionals to explore disease surveillance data by interactively drilling into and cross-tabulating data.</p>
        <h3>Dashboard</h3>
        <p>The CSI TriSano™ AVR feature includes allows you to create a dashboard that can display key reports and charts automatically when you login to the system. This lets you quickly see the status of cases, diseases, jurisdictions, and more. The dashboard is fully integrated with Pentaho™ Reporting and Pentaho™ Analysis so that you can drill into underlying reports and analysis to understand what factors are contributing to the current situation.</p>
