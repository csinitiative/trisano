        <h1>How do I delete a contact?</h1>
        <p>You can delete contacts in different places, depending on their routing status:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If the contact has been routed, it will appear on the <b class="green">Events</b> list and you can delete it right from the list:<ol><li value="1">Click <b class="green">Events</b> in the upper right corner of the page.</li><li value="2">Locate the contact that you want to delete.</li><li value="3">Click <b class="green">Delete</b>. A message appears asking you to confirm that you want to delete the contact.</li><li value="4">To confirm that you want to delete the contact, click <b class="green">Yes</b>. To cancel the deletion, click <b class="green">No</b>. Deleted contacts are still listed on the Events list, but they are listed in gray, italic type.</li></ol></li>
            <li value="2">If the contact has not been routed, you can delete it from the <b class="green">Contacts</b> tab of the CMR it belongs to.</li>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">Click <b class="green">Events</b> in the upper right corner of the page.</li>
                <li value="2">Locate the Morbidity event that the contact belongs to and click <b class="green">Show</b>.</li>
                <li value="3">Click <b class="green">Delete</b>. A message appears asking you to confirm that you want to delete the contact.</li>
                <li value="4">To confirm that you want to delete the contact, click <b class="green">Yes</b>. To cancel the deletion, click <b class="green">No</b>. Deleted contacts are still listed on the Contacts tab of the CMR they belong to, but they are listed with strike-through characters.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>If you confirm deletion of a contact:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">it remains in the database</li>
            <li value="2">it appears as dimmed in the event list or as strike-through characters elsewhere</li>
            <li value="3">it can still be viewed using the <a href="../About_Events/Showing_an_Event.htm">Show</a> command</li>
            <li value="4">it is included in searches</li>
            <li value="5">it appears with strike-through out in search results</li>
            <li value="6">it is not exported to the CDC or to an IBIS query</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, you can still use deleted contacts for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">you can edit deleted contacts</li>
            <li value="2">you can route deleted contacts</li>
        </ul>
