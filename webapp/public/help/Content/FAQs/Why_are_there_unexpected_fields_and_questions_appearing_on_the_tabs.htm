        <h1>Why are there unexpected fields and questions appearing on the tabs?</h1>
        <p>CSI TriSano™ contains a collection of built-in fields called core fields. These are the fields you may already be familiar with if you have been working with the application for a little while. They are standard and appear predictably.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition, you may come across some new fields or questions that are not consistent with what you expect. In other words, for some diseases, a tab contains a specific list of easily recognizable fields. For another disease, there may be fields or questions appearing on one or more of the tabs that you have not seen before. These are user-defined fields created within the Form Builder area of the program. Form Builder is a tool that allows administrative users to recreate within CSI TriSano™ surveillance forms. As part of creating a form, administrative users can define new fields and questions and place them on almost any tab within the application. If you are seeing fields you did not expect, they were most likely created for a specific form for a specific disease.</p>
