        <h1>Why can't I delete a disease?</h1>
        <p>The whole purpose of CSI TriSano™ is to report useful information about diseases. Even though it may make sense to your organization to remove certain diseases from the list of diseases, it is important to keep them around for several reasons:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The diseases may have been chosen for and linked to one or more events. If you deleted the disease, these events would either contain no disease information or they would be deleted.</li>
            <li value="2">The CDC may still require information on the disease so it is important to keep all event data associated with it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
