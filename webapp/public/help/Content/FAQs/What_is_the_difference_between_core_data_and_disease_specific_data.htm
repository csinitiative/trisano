        <h1>What is the difference between core data and disease specific data?</h1>
        <p> Although you may not notice it right away while you are entering patient information, there are two types of data that you will work with:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b class="green">Core data</b> consists of all the built-in fields available in the application. These are static, uneditable fields that are not dependent on the chosen disease.</li>
            <li value="2"><b class="green">Disease-specific data</b> consists of fields defined by a user in the creation of forms for a specific disease. Disease-specific data differs from disease to disease and can appear nearly anywhere, on any tab, as defined when you create forms for the disease.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
