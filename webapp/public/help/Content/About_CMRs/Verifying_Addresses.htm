        <h2>Verifying Addresses</h2>
        <p>Most events contain address information. The address verification feature allows you to verify address information based on the entries made in the combination of all the address-related fields. It compares them with a database of all known addresses and displays updated, verified information for you, if you have entered enough information.</p>
        <p>The address verification feature is available in the following places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Demographic tab of all event types</li>
            <li value="2">Contact events on the Contacts tab of Morbidity events</li>
            <li value="3">Place Exposures on the Epidemiological tab of Morbidity events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To use address verification:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Open one of the above-listed pages for the patient, contact, or place. </li>
            <li value="2">Locate the <b class="green">Address</b> fields and make sure they are as complete as possible. The address look-up feature is fairly forgiving, so you don't need to complete every field if you don't have all the information. In fact, you can use the look-up feature to help complete missing address information.</li>
            <li value="3">Click <b class="green">Look Up Address</b>. The application checks the address and if there is sufficient address information, displays the verified (sometimes corrected) address below the <b class="green">Look Up Address</b> link. If there isn't enough address information, the application tells you so. In this case, you will not be able to verify the address nor will you be able to include this patient, contact, or place in <a href="Mapping_Addresses.htm">mapped results</a>.</li>
            <li value="4">If the look-up feature found the address you entered, you can:</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Click <b class="green">Update Coordinates</b>. The <b class="green">Longitude</b> and <b class="green">Latitude</b> fields will be updated, but the Address fields will remain as you entered them.</li>
                <li value="2">Click <b class="green">Update Address</b>. The <b class="green">Longitude</b> and <b class="green">Latitude</b> fields will be updated and the <b class="green">Address</b> fields will be updated with the found address information.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="5">Click <b class="green">Save &amp; Continue</b>.</li>
