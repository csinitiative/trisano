        <h2>Choosing a Disease</h2>
        <p>When you choose a disease on the <a href="Clinical_Information.htm">Clinical</a> tab of a CMR, you set into motion the process of possibly adding new fields or even new tabs to the existing tabs—Demographic, Clinical, and so on—within the CMR. In addition, disease-specific fields and tabs may be added to the <a href="Investigation_Information.htm">Investigation</a> tab. The new fields and tabs are created when a user with administrator privileges designs a form in Form Builder. </p>
        <p>Form Builder is a tool that allows  you to extend the capabilities of CSI TriSano™ by capturing  additional information for existing or new public health situations. Form  Builder can be extremely useful during a disease outbreak. It helps you respond quickly  to emerging or changing health events by allowing you to create customized  forms. The new form can help you capture additional information for each of the  event types including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="Confidential_Morbidity_Report.htm">Morbidity events (CMRs)</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="../About_Events/What_is_a_Contact_Event.htm">Contact events</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="../About_Events/What_is_an_Encounter_Event.htm">Encounter events</a>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><a href="../About_Events/What_is_a_Place_Exposure.htm">Place Exposures</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if your local health department receives a form from the CDC that asks many questions about a recent outbreak of disease, such as the H1N1 virus, a user with administrative privileges could use that form to create a custom form in Form Builder. As part of creating that custom form, the administrator can add questions to the existing tabs of the CMR or to the Investigation tab. These questions are added to the tabs of the CMR when you choose the disease, in this example, H1N1 in the <b class="green">Disease</b> field on the <b class="green">Clinical</b> tab and select one of the Save options.</p>
        <p>It's a good idea to select the Disease as soon as possible while entering information about the event. This way, any fields, questions, or tabs that have been added in association with Form Builder will be added to the tabs right away, giving you the greatest opportunity to gather vital information.</p>
