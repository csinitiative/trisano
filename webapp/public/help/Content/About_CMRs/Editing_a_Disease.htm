        <h2>Editing a Disease</h2>
        <p>When you choose a disease on the <a href="Clinical_Information.htm">Clinical</a> tab of a CMR, you set into motion the process of possibly adding new fields or even new tabs to the existing tabs—Demographic, Clinical, and so on—within the CMR. In addition, disease-specific fields and tabs may be added to the <a href="Investigation_Information.htm">Investigation</a> tab. The new fields and tabs are created when a user with administrator privileges designs a form in Form Builder. </p>
        <p>When you edit the selected disease, meaning you select a different disease from the <b class="green">Disease</b> drop-down of the <b class="green">Clinical</b> tab after you have already saved the CMR with the initially selected disease, it's important to understand the consequences of this action. Keep the following points in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">When you edit a disease, the disease changes, but any disease-specific fields (added to the tabs as a result of form creation in Form Builder) will not be removed from the tabs automatically. You must use the <a href="Investigation_Information.htm">Investigation</a> tab to remove disease-specific data for the previously selected disease.</li>
            <li value="2">New disease-specific fields associated with the newly selected Disease will not automatically be added to the CMR. If the new disease requires a disease-specific form, you must use the <a href="Investigation_Information.htm">Investigation</a> tab to add that form to the event.</li>
            <li value="3">Some forms apply to more than one disease. It's possible the form associated with the initially selected disease will also apply to the new disease.</li>
        </ul>
