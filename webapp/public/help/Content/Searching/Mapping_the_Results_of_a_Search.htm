        <h2>Mapping the Results of a Search</h2>
        <p>After you have performed a search, you may want to see those results on a map. Seeing the results on a map may be helpful in determining patterns of infection or location.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To map the results:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><a href="Performing_a_Search.htm">Perform a search</a> using the criteria that you need.</li>
            <li value="2">When the search is done, the results are displayed at the bottom of the search page.</li>
            <li value="3">Review the results. Below the search results is a link called <b class="green">Show Map of Results</b>. If the link does not appear, it means that none of the events listed in the search results contain map coordinates, i.e., the <b class="green">Longitude</b> and <b class="green">Latitude</b> fields on the Demographic tab for these events are either empty or need to be updated.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <b class="green">Show Map of Results</b>. A map is displayed at the bottom of the page.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Viewing Mapped Results</h3>
        <p>The results map shows you a small tag for each of the events listed in the search results. Listed events that are missing address information, will not appear on the map.</p>
        <p>The message, <i>Some results need to be updated with map coordinates</i> sometimes appears next to the <b class="green">Show map of results</b> link. You will see this message when one or more of the search results have blank <b class="green">Longitude</b> and <b class="green">Latitude</b> fields. To fix this situation, you must update each patient or contact individually. To update the coordinates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">In the search results area of the page, click the <b class="green">Record Number</b> of one of the events whose <b class="green">Demographic</b> tab is missing address information. You can predict which ones are missing address information by inspecting the <b class="green">City</b> column of the search results. If the <b class="green">City</b> column is empty, it probably means that this patient's address coordinates need to be updated.</li>
            <li value="2">When the page for the events opens, click <b class="green">Edit</b>. </li>
            <li value="3">Locate the <b class="green">Address</b> fields and make sure they are as complete as possible.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <b class="green">Look Up Address</b>. The application checks the address and if there is sufficient address information, displays the verified (sometimes corrected) address below the <b class="green">Look Up Address</b> link. If there isn't enough address information, the application tells you so. In this case, you will not be able to include this patient or contact in the mapped results.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <b class="green">Update Coordinates</b>. The <b class="green">Longitude</b> and <b class="green">Latitude</b> fields will be updated if the address fields contain enough information.</li>
            <li value="6">Click <b class="green">Save &amp; Continue</b>.</li>
        </ol>
