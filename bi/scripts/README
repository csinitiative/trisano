INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING A NEW DATA WAREHOUSE DATABASE:

1) Create an empty database with the owner set to the user who will run the ETL
   process
    # createdb -O nedss trisano_warehouse

2) Make sure there's a public schema in this database, owned by the user that
   owns the database. By default the new database will copy the template1
   database kto know what schemas to have and who should own them.
    # psql trisano_warehouse
    > ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO nedss

3) Edit the warehouse_init.sql script to use the right owner name and data
   warehouse user name (i.e. replace "nedss" and "nedss_dw" with whatever
   user you need)

4) Run the warehouse_init.sql to populate the database
    # psql -X -h host -U nedss -d trisano_warehouse -f warehouse_init.sql 

5) Modify the configuration settings at the top of the etl.sh script to set
   variables properly. 

6) Run the etl.sh script once to finish populating the trisano schema in the
   warehouse database. Make sure it runs cleanly.
    # sh etl.sh

7) Run the etl.sh script a couple more times to make sure it runs cleanly, and
   alternates between the schemas it uses.

8) Configure cron or some such to run the etl.sh script as often as you see fit
