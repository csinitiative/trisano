In order to ensure reproduceable builds and simplified deployments over the many years TriSano will be in service, we have checked in the dependant libs here.

The lib directory is strategically placed directly off the root of the project (trisano directory) so that developers do not need to download this large directory for each new checkout. Developers are encouraged to check out this lib directory separately into a project and then check out the webapp directory for actual application development purposes.
