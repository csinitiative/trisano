Story: Search user acceptance tests

  As an investigator
  I want to search for people
  So I can know if they are already in the system

  Scenario: Search for known users
    
    Given I am logged in as an investigator
    And a person named Karl Marks, born 02/17/1977, gender male, and residing in Daggett County is created
    When I search for Karl Marks

    Then Karl Marks should appear in the search results
    And 31 / 1977-02-17 should appear in the search results
    And Male should appear in the search results
    And Daggett should appear in the search results

  Scenario: Search for users known not to exist

    Given I am logged in as an investigator
    And no person named Xavier Xerces exists

    When I search for Xavier Xerces
    Then Xavier Xerces should not be returned

  Scenario: Search for users with their names slightly mis-spelled

    Given I am logged in as an investigator
    And a person named Karl Marks is created

    Then Karl Marks should appear in the search results

  Scenario: Search for users with their first and last names transposed

    Given I am logged in as an investigator
    And a person named Karl Marks is created

    Then Karl Marks should appear in the search results

  Scenario: Search for users by correct birthdate

    Given I am logged in as an investigator
