TO CREATE UTAH POPULATION TABLES

* Go to http://wonder.cdc.gov/population.html
* Select "Data Request" for the latest available year
* Group results by age, county, gender, and race
* Select Utah
* Select "Export Results", and uncheck "Show Totals"
* Select "County level" at the bottom
* Click "Send"
* Save the file someplace
* Run import.sh to import the file into a table called "population"

The import.sh script uses bash, and takes four parameters: a database name, a
schema name, the input file name, and a four-digit year. The database and
schema names will determine where the finished file shows up. The input file
name is the name of the CDC download, and the year is the year of the data
request you selected in the second step of this process.

Note that import.sql contains some important tables to translate county names
to health department names, and to make intelligent guesses at the proper split
of multi-racial categories into single-race groups. You may need to edit these
at some point.
