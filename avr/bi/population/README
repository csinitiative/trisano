TO CREATE UTAH POPULATION TABLES

* Go to http://wonder.cdc.gov/population.html
* Select "Data Request" for the latest available year
* Group results by age, county, gender, and race
* Select Utah
* Select "Export Results", and uncheck "Show Totals"
* Select "County level" at the bottom
* Click "Send"
* Save the file someplace
* Edit import.sh to give it the appropriate database and input file names
* Run import.sh to import the file into a table called "population"

Note that import.sql contains some important tables to translate county names
to health department names, and to make intelligent guesses at the proper split
of multi-racial categories into single-race groups. You may need to edit these
at some point.
