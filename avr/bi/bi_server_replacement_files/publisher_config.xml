<!--
	This file must be configured before client tools
	will be able to publish onto the server. Publishing
	involves accepting a file (action sequence, xml document,
	anything) and placing it into the solution. This
	action should only be allowed if the tool is configured
	with a server/deployment specific password. The 
	RepositoryFilePublisher is now coded to expect an MD5
	hash of the password entered here before it will allow
	publish into the server.
	
	This is a critical security measure designed to prevent
	malicious actions from being published into your server.
	Please take care to make the password sufficiently
	difficult to guess. Also take care that the contents of
	this file are not generally available
