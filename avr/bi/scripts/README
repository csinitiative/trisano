INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING A NEW DATA WAREHOUSE DATABASE:

0) As a Postgres super user (typically named 'postgres') 
    # sudo su postgres

1) Create a database user, trisano_su, who will 'own' the data warehouse
    # createuser -S -D -R -P trisano_su
   You'll be prompted to create a password.  Do so and memorize it.

2) Create an empty database with the owner set to the user just created
    # createdb -O trisano_su trisano_warehouse

3) Make sure there's a public schema in this database owned by the user
   just created
    # psql trisano_warehouse
    > ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO trisano_su;
    > \q

4) Create a user that will have only read access to the data warehouse.
    # createuser -S -D -R -P trisano_ro
   You'll be prompted to create a password.  Do so and memorize it.
     
5) If your user names are other than trisano_su and trisano_ro, then edit the 
   warehouse_init.sql script to use the right owner name and data
   warehouse user name (i.e. replace "trisano_su" and "trisano_ro" with whatever
   users you need)

6) Run the warehouse_init.sql to populate the database. Change 'host' below
   as needed.
    # psql -X -h host -U trisano_su -d trisano_warehouse -f warehouse_init.sql 

7) Modify the configuration settings at the top of the etl.sh script to set
   variables properly. 

8) Run the etl.sh script once to finish populating the trisano schema in the
   warehouse database. Make sure it runs cleanly.
    # ./etl.sh

9) Run the etl.sh script a couple more times to make sure it runs cleanly, and
   alternates between the schemas it uses.

10) Configure cron or some such to run the etl.sh script as often as you see fit
